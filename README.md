## Notes for Reviewer

### Time Allocation

The development of this project was conducted in approximately 5-6 hours, fragmented across multiple sessions to accommodate my existing professional commitments.

### Technical Challenges

My primary experience in styling web applications over the last three years has been with CSS-in-JS solutions. Given the time constraints of this assessment and my expertise with these libraries, I opted to rely predominantly on CSS-in-JS for stylingâ€”accounting for approximately 95% of the project's styles.

### Areas for Future Enhancement

With additional time, several areas could be refined for a more robust application:

- **Styling Refinement**: A more polished and cohesive design language could be implemented.
- **Responsive Design**: Further work could ensure a seamless user experience across various screen sizes.
- **Accessibility**: The addition of key accessibility features would make the application more inclusive.
- **SASS Utilization**: The use of SASS could be expanded for a more optimized styling architecture.
